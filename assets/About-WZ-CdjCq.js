The Malai Chicken Tikka appetizer was so tender and tasty and paired with a sauce for dipping. The Chicken Tariwala was very flavourful and beautifully presented. The Butter Garlic Nan was made fresh to order and was very soft and good. The staff were all extremely friendly and inviting. They were very polite and attentive to customer needs and wants.
